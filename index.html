        <h1>Overcoming Procrastination</h1>
        <p>Procrastination is a challenge faced by many people, but research has shown that it can be managed with the right strategies. Below are three research-backed solutions to help decrease stress and combat procrastination (that are actually real).</p>

        <h2>1. Breaking Tasks into Smaller Steps</h2>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can prevent you from being overwhelmed and make it easier to get started on and complete work. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, setting small, achievable goals increases the likelihood of task completion by up to <strong>70%</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Time Management Techniques</h2>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work in focused intervals (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks, have been shown to improve focus and productivity. Research from the University of Illinois found that structured breaks can enhance performance and reduce mental fatigue by <strong>16%</strong>. In addition, several studies published by Alexander HÃ¤fner, a German researcher, found that perceived stress can be significantly reduced by implementing such time management techniques.</p>

        <h2>3. Positive Feedback and Self-Forgiveness</h2>
        <div class="solution">
		<p>Counterintuitively, multiple studies point to the fact that self-forgiveness can mitigate procrastination, since procrastination frequently stems from a cycle of negative emotions. For example, a study published in the journal <em>Psychological Science</em> showed that self-compassion can reduce procrastination by up to <strong>50%</strong>; similar findings were published by Michael Wohl, a researcher and professor at Carleton University, in his 2010 study "I forgive myself, now I can study: How self-forgiveness for procrastinating can reduce future procrastination".</p>
